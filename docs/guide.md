# Nautilus Log User Guide

[Back to README](../README.md) · [简体中文](./guide.zh-CN.md)

## Plan format

Add fixed events and flexible tasks as direct children of a Nautilus Log component.
Their Roam block order is the task priority.

```text
05:00-06:00 Morning routine
{{[[TODO]]}} Write project brief 45m
{{[[TODO]]}} Review notes 30m
11:45-12:30 Lunch
```

- A time range is a fixed event.
- An unfinished TODO is a flexible task.
- Durations support `30m`, `30min`, `1h`, and `1h30m`.
- Untimed tasks use **Default Todo Duration**.
- **Urgent Trigger Word** changes a task's color, not its scheduling order.

## Scheduling rules

1. Fixed events claim their written time ranges.
2. Unfinished direct-child TODOs are read in Roam block order.
3. Starting at the current moment, complete tasks fill the next continuous gaps large
   enough for them.
4. Time passing moves unfinished work forward without changing priority.
5. Tasks that cannot fit before the configured end enter **Today won't fit**.

The scheduler is deterministic and does not generate estimates. A task remains atomic:
if it cannot fit one gap, it moves to the next suitable gap instead of being split.

## Header metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Planned | Remaining flexible-task demand; `left` percentage = `current free time ÷ full-day Available` |
| Remaining | Available time left after Planned demand |
| Overload | Demand beyond available time |
| No fitting slot | Time exists in total, but no continuous gap can hold an atomic task |
| Available | Flexible time remaining now / full configured-day flexible time |
| Events | Fixed-event time remaining now / full configured-day event time |

Overlapping events are counted as a union, so one minute is never counted twice. The
small flame marks whether the current minute is consuming Available or Event time.

## Visual language

- Red: urgent task
- Yellow: fixed event
- Blue: flexible task
- Red needle: current time
- Muted completed/event slices: recorded past
- Hatched past slice: elapsed time without a recorded item

Past gaps are factual schedule data, not a judgment that time was wasted.

## Chart controls

- **Eye:** show or hide completed items.
- **Play:** replay the configured day without changing Roam blocks.
- **Collapse:** hide this chart instance while keeping its plan blocks visible.

Hover or keyboard-focus a task/event slice to see its exact range and duration.
Future blank slots show the same preview on wide charts. Compact sidebar charts omit
hover tooltips and keep the Schedule section folded to avoid clipping and visual noise.

## Execution Layer

The optional Execution Layer defaults to **off**. Its advanced settings remain hidden
until enabled, and Nautilus Log loads no execution panel, timer poller, commands, or
CLOCK writer while it is off.

When enabled, the first Nautilus Log on today's Daily Note becomes the **Primary
Plan** used by the topbar panel.

| View | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Timing | Current Timing Line and recently closed tasks |
| Plan | Unfinished direct-child tasks from the Primary Plan |
| Review | Today's Planned, Actual, and valid variance states |

Only one CLOCK runs at a time. Switching tasks closes the previous CLOCK and opens the
next at the same instant. With **Keep Timing Line first in right sidebar** enabled,
Clock In also opens or moves the active task to the top of Roam's sidebar.

Recent retention defaults to 45 minutes. The Pomodoro threshold defaults to 45
minutes and changes the live signal without stopping work. When no task CLOCK is
active, the panel-header stopwatch starts a standalone count-up POMO. It writes no
Roam blocks and does not affect Actual, Planned, Review, or the spiral; starting a
task CLOCK clears it because CLOCK always has priority. The forgotten-timer warning
defaults to 120 minutes and never stops or deletes a CLOCK. Enter `0` to disable
Recent or the forgotten-timer warning.

## Planned and Actual history

- Unfinished tasks are scheduled from Planned estimates.
- Completed flexible tasks prefer total valid same-day Actual time.
- Multiple CLOCK sessions remain separate in `LOGBOOK::`, while the spiral combines
  their total into one historical slice.
- Actual time is never capped at Planned time.
- Without Actual, Planned history requires an explicit completion anchor such as
  `d18:21`.
- Without an Actual end or completion anchor, Nautilus Log does not invent history.
- For an overnight chart window, next-day CLOCK time remains part of the owning
  Daily Note until that window ends.

Todo Trigger is optional. Its completion timestamp can supply the `dHH:MM` anchor,
but ordinary planning and completion do not require it.

## Settings

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Language | English |
| Chart Start Time | 05:00 |
| Chart End Time | 21:00 |
| Component Prefix | `[[Nautilus Log]]` |
| Legend Max Length | 22 |
| Default Todo Duration | 15 minutes |
| Urgent Trigger Word | Empty |
| Execution Layer · Advanced | Off |
| Keep Timing Line first in right sidebar | On |
| Pomodoro Threshold | 45 minutes |
| Recent Retention | 45 minutes; `0` disables |
| Forgotten Timer Warning | 120 minutes; `0` disables |

Chart start can be any whole hour from 00:00–23:00. Chart end can be 01:00–24:00;
an end hour at or before Start is explicitly labelled **next day**. For example,
21:00–02:00 is one continuous 300-minute window owned by the Daily Note where the
component appears. Existing templates keep working and the default remains
05:00–21:00.

Execution-specific settings are revealed only while **Execution Layer · Advanced** is
enabled.

## Commands

The Command Palette exposes:

- **Nautilus Log: 1. Focus current block**
- **Nautilus Log: 2. Clock out Timing Line**
- **Nautilus Log: 3. Locate Primary Plan**

Bind them in **Roam Settings → Hotkeys**. TODO context menus also expose Clock In and
Clock Out.

## Data and safety

Actual time is stored as compatible Org-style graph data:

```text
{{[[TODO]]}} Task 30m
  - LOGBOOK::
    - CLOCK: [2026-08-22 Sat 10:00]--[2026-08-22 Sat 10:18] => 0:18
```

Disable the separate Roam Logbook extension before enabling Actual Time Tracking;
Nautilus Log refuses to start a second CLOCK writer. Multiple charts may exist on a
page, but only the first chart on today's Daily Note becomes the execution panel's
Primary Plan. Breadcrumb and collapsed-path replicas skip expensive chart rendering;
right-sidebar views use the compact chart with a folded Schedule section. Unloading
the extension does not rewrite or delete user blocks.
